# 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Detection - AI/ML Project

This project is built by BCA final year students to detect Alzheimer's Disease using deep learning and brain MRI images.

It uses Python and machine learning to classify MRI images into 4 categories:
- AD: Alzheimer’s Disease
- CN: Cognitively Normal
- EMCI: Early Mild Cognitive Impairment
- LMCI: Late Mild Cognitive Impairment

## 📦 Features

- Easy to train and test
- Built using Python and TensorFlow
- Google Colab/Local Support
- Open for contributions via feature branches
