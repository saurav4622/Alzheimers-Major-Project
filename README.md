# 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using AI/ML

This is a deep learning-based project for detecting Alzheimer’s Disease using MRI scan images. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify brain scans into four categories: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Cognitively Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), and Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI).

## 📊 Dataset Overview

You need to download the dataset manually from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It includes brain MRI images categorized into:

| Category | Description                      | Count |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------|
| AD       | Alzheimer’s Disease              | 8960  |
| CN       | Cognitively Normal               | 6464  |
| EMCI     | Early Mild Cognitive Impairment  | 9600  |
| LMCI     | Late Mild Cognitive Impairment   | 8960  |

Place it in this structure after download:

```

├── AD/
├── CN/
├── EMCI/
└── LMCI/
```

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

### ✅ 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saurav4622/Alzheimers-Major-Project.git
cd Alzheimers-Major-Project
```

### ✅ 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### ✅ 3. Install required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ✅ 4. Download and place the dataset

- Go to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and download the Alzheimer's MRI dataset.
- Create a folder `data/` in the project root and place the class folders inside.

### ✅ 5. Run the model

- Option 1: Use Google Colab
  - Open `notebooks/alzheimers_classification.ipynb` in Colab
  - Upload dataset to Colab or mount Google Drive
- Option 2: Use Python script
  ```bash
  python train_model.py
  ```
